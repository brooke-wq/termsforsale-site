# Deal Pros LLC — Codebase Guide + Paperclip AI OS

## Project Overview

Deal Pros LLC is a real estate wholesale company that operates two public-facing sites and an AI-powered back-office stack called **Paperclip**:

- **Terms For Sale** (`termsforsale/`) — buyer-facing deal marketplace. Sellers submit leads, buyers browse and claim deals, VIP buyers get early access.
- **Dispo Buddy** (`dispobuddy/`) — JV partner-facing site where wholesalers submit off-market deals to Deal Pros' buyer network.
- **Netlify Functions** (`termsforsale/netlify/functions/`) — serverless API layer powering all dynamic features: CRM sync, AI underwriting, deal alerts, auth, image proxying, and more.

The stack is intentionally lightweight: plain HTML/CSS/JS on the front end, Netlify Functions on the back end, GoHighLevel (GHL) as the CRM, Notion as the deal database, and Claude AI for underwriting.

### Shared Helpers

**`_ghl.js`** — GoHighLevel API utilities. Import with:
```js
const { getContact, upsertContact, addTag, removeTag, updateContactField } = require('./_ghl');
```

**`_claude.js`** — Claude API wrapper (native fetch, no SDK). Import with:
```js
const { askClaude } = require('./_claude');
```
**Always use `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` model** in `_claude.js` calls to minimize API costs. Haiku is fast and cheap; reserve Sonnet only if output quality is provably insufficient.

---

## Environment Variables

These are set in Netlify's environment variable dashboard. **Never hardcode values — always use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.**

```
GHL_API_KEY             GoHighLevel private API key
GHL_LOCATION_ID         GHL location/sub-account ID
NOTION_TOKEN            Notion integration secret
NOTION_DATABASE_ID      Main deals database
CLAUDE_API_KEY          Anthropic Claude API key
GITHUB_TOKEN            GitHub API token (for create-post VA builder)
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT  Google Drive service account JSON (base64)
```

## Coding Conventions

- **Runtime:** Node 18+ (Netlify default)
- **Module format:** CommonJS (`require` / `module.exports`) — no ES modules
- **No npm packages:** Use Node built-ins and native `fetch` only. No `axios`, `node-fetch`, or other HTTP libraries.
- **CORS headers:** Every function must return `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and handle `OPTIONS` preflight
- **Error handling:** Always wrap handler body in `try/catch`, return `500` with `{ error: err.message }`
- **Logging:** Use `console.log` / `console.error` — logs appear in Netlify function logs
- **No frameworks:** Plain JS, no Express, no Hapi

### Function Template

```js
exports.handler = async (event, context) => {
  const headers = {
    'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
    'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  };

  if (event.httpMethod === 'OPTIONS') {
    return { statusCode: 200, headers, body: '' };
  }

  try {
    // your logic here
    return { statusCode: 200, headers, body: JSON.stringify({ success: true }) };
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error:', err);
    return { statusCode: 500, headers, body: JSON.stringify({ error: err.message }) };
  }
};
```

---

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` triggers an automatic Netlify deploy. There is no manual build step.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "describe your change"
git push origin main
```

Monitor deploys at: https://app.netlify.com/sites/termsforsale/deploys

The VS Code "Deploy to Netlify" task (Cmd+Shift+B) automates this.

## Key Notes for AI Agents

- `deal.html` has an `init();` call at the bottom of its `<script>` block — **do not remove it**
- **Deal page label rules (DO NOT CHANGE):**
  - "IF not Cash" field → MUST be labeled **"Entry Fee"** with **"+ CC/TC"** suffix
  - SubTo deals payment → MUST be labeled **"PITI (est)"** (NOT "Principle & Interest")
  - Seller Finance deals payment → MUST be labeled **"Principal & Interest"** (NOT "SF Payment")
  - Hybrid/Morby deals with SF portion → SF portion uses "Principal & Interest", SubTo portion uses "PITI (est)"
  - **No "Close of Escrow" or "Closes in X days"** anywhere on deal pages or cards
- **Photo display rules:**
  - Photos sort by `createdTime` (first uploaded = cover photo, usually front of house)
  - Do NOT change photo sort order to alphabetical
  - Photo grid orientation must remain consistent (landscape main photo, square thumbs)
- `/api/*` routes are aliases for `/.netlify/functions/*` — both work; prefer `/api/` in frontend code
- Notion deal status `"Actively Marketing"` is the filter used by `deals.js` to show live deals
- GHL is the source of truth for contacts/leads; Notion is the source of truth for deal inventory
- The `termsforsale-site/lead-engine/` subdirectory is a separate Next.js app — do not modify unless specifically working on it

### Auto-Deploy

GitHub webhook fires on push to main → Droplet's `deploy-hook.js` (port 9000) pulls latest code automatically.

### GHL Configuration (Single Location)

- **Location ID:** `7IyUgu1zpi38MDYpSDTs` (Terms For Sale — used for all sub-accounts)
- **API Key:** stored in `GHL_API_KEY` env var
- **CEO Briefing Contact ID:** `qO4YuZHrhGTTBaFKPDYD`
- **Brooke Contact ID:** `1HMBtAv9EuTlJa5EekAL`
- **Brooke Phone:** `+15167120113`

### Tag-Based Automation Flow

```
Seller submits form → lead-new tag → lead-intake scores it
  → if hot (35+): uw-requested tag → underwriting-poller
  → uw-complete tag → seller-call-prep → call-prepped tag

Buyer signs up → buyer-signup tag → buyer-relations profiles them
  → buyer-active tag → notify-buyers matches to deals → SMS + email

JV partner submits → jv-submitted tag → dispo-buddy-triage (DEFERRED)
  → if viable: uw-requested → underwriting → partner SMS

Contact tagged pkg-requested → deal-package-poller → pkg-complete
```

### SMS & Email Confirmations

All form submissions send confirmation SMS + email:
- **Signup** → welcome SMS + branded email (via auth-signup.js)
- **VIP Signup** → VIP welcome SMS + email (via vip-buyer-submit.js)
- **Buying Criteria** → recap email + internal SMS to Brooke (via buyer-inquiry.js)
- **Deal Match** → SMS + branded deal alert email with photo (via notify-buyers.js)

### Notion Database

- **DB ID:** `a3c0a38fd9294d758dedabab2548ff29`
- **Key fields:** Street Address, City, State, Deal Type, Asking Price, Entry Fee, Deal Status, Date Funded, Amount Funded, Date Assigned
- **"Closed" detection:** Uses `Date Funded` field (not last_edited_time)

### Monthly Cost

- DigitalOcean Droplet: $6/mo
- Claude API (Sonnet): ~$4/mo at current volume
- **Total: ~$10/mo**

## TODO — Next Session

These items are deferred and MUST be completed in the next session:

1. **Split-Screen Map Homepage** — Zillow/Redfin style: left panel scrollable deal cards with filters, right panel interactive map with pins. Click pin → highlight deal card. Click deal → highlight pin. Responsive: stacks on mobile.

2. **Client Portal + Real Auth** — Authenticated buyer dashboard with saved deals, offer tracking, buy box management, deal alerts history. Current auth is localStorage-only (no password verification). Needs real GHL-backed auth: verify email+password against GHL contacts, session management, protected routes. Separate project, done correctly.

3. **Per-Contact Deal View Tracking** — When a logged-in user views a deal page, log it to their GHL contact (add `deal-viewed` tag, post note with deal address/URL, update custom field with last viewed deal). Also integrate GHL trigger links into deal alert emails so clicks are tracked in GHL workflows. Goal: Brooke can see in GHL exactly which deals each buyer clicked on.

4. **New Dispo Buddy Website** — When ready, re-enable `jv-submitted` tag in `dispo-buddy-submit.js` and confirmation SMS. Connect new site forms to existing triage automation.

5. **GHL Booking Notification** — Set up in GHL Calendars → Notifications for calendar PoyDG0tNCK8wb9oi6zZ4 → notify Brooke + Eddie on new bookings.

6. **Auto-Tag Buyer Responses** — Create GHL workflow to auto-tag when buyer replies to deal follow-up:
   - Trigger: Customer Reply (SMS)
   - Reply "1" or "IN" → add tag `deal-hot`
   - Reply "2" or "MAYBE" → add tag `deal-warm`
   - Reply "3" or "PASS" → add tag `deal-paused`
   - Same for email replies with IN/MAYBE/PASS
   - These tags stop the 3-day follow-up sprint from sending further messages
